/*
Step 1 : We have to find the largest word from the data given by the client.
Step 2 : We create a box that contains the first element of the data (arr[0]).
step 3 : We start looping inside the data from the second (arr[1]) element to last one.
step 4 : We start comparing if it is bigger or equal to the length of the box.
step 5 : Then we return the value of the box.
